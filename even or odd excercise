The first part of the excercise asks the user for a number and then returns a statement based on if its even or odd
'''
varNumber = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if varNumber%2 == 0 :
    print("You have entered the number ", varNumber, " which is an even number")
else :
    print("You have entered the number ", varNumber, " which is an odd number")
    

'''
The second part of this excercise returns an additional statement based on if varNumber is divisible by 4
and another statement based on if varNumber is divisible by varOtherNumber
